## Anyline Xamarin SDK ##

Anyline provides an easy-to-use SDK for applications to enable Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on mobile devices.

### BindingSource

The `Anyline Xamarin SDK.sln` Visual Studio solution located in the /BindingSource directory inhibits two projects: The project for Android bindings `AnylineXamarinSDK.Droid` and the iOS bindings project `AnylineXamarinSDK.iOS`.


#### Android: AnylineXamarinSDK.Droid

The Android Binding project creates a Bindings library from the provided Anyline Java library (.aar file), given Metadata.xml transforms and Additional C# code.

Located in the [Assets/tools](BindingSource/AnylineXamarinSDK.Droid/Assets/tools) directory lies the javadoc and python scripts to automatize parameter naming fixes, as the Xamarin build tool is not able to keep the correct parameter names after binding.


#### iOS: AnylineXamarinSDK.iOS

The iOS Binding project provides easy compilation from the provided Anyline framework, given linker & binding definitions via `Anyline.linkwith.cs`, `ApiDefinition.cs` and `StructsAndEnums.cs`.

The binding definitions are generated by the Xamarin tool [Objective Sharpie](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/cross-platform/macios/binding/objective-sharpie/ )


### Examples

The [Examples](Examples) directory provides source code for the Anyline Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android Example apps. Simply build & run the example project for your desired platform and enjoy scanning :)
